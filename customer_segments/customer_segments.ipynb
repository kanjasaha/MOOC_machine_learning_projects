    "_Create customer segmentation based on RFM score (Recency, Frequency and Monetization) using cluster analyis._\n",
    "\n",
    "A company exists because of its customers; to be precise, its loyal customers. \n",
    "A loyal customer is a satisfied customer whose trust we have earned. And the word \"trust\" carries a lot of weight and is only earned through consistent positive value of product, service and experience proving that you \"know your customer\". To reflect that we indeed know our customer, the very first step is that we do not broadcast but communicate with our customers on a individual level. Marketing is just that, a platform for conversation with our userbase.\n",
    "\n",
    "One very important KPI or business metric used to track performance of marketing campaigns is click through rate(CTR) i.e the percentage of people who clicks on a specific link among total users who view a page, email, or advertisement. This measures engagement with the marketing campaign and our goal is to improve upon that.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to maximize CTR is to create targeted campaigns i.e. to customize campaigns for a group of users within similar demographics/psychographics. This process of finding cutomer groups for personalized communication is called customer segmentation. One of the very popular way of creating customer segments is through RFM score.\n",
    "\n",
    "RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a marketing model for spend behavior based customer segmentation. It groups customers based on their transaction history – how recently, how often and how much did they buy. With increasing focus on customer relationship management (CRM), RFM has become an integral part of marketing and business analytics. In machine learning domain, RFM based segmentation is generated through cluster analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I have used [online retail dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail) available at UCI machine learning repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "Five number summary of the dataset implied Monetization scale is different from Recency and Frequency values.Normalization is required for RFM score calculation otheriwse monetization will have higher weightage than Recency and Frequency. I decided to use Eucledean distance metric as we have only 3 dimensinoal data and eucledean and simple as effective in lower diemnsiona.\n",
    "\n",
    "After exploratory analysis with data visualization, here are my observtions:\n",
    "1. All observations are in one large non spherical cluster. \n",
    "2. 93% of the observations have atleast one neighor within .001 unit.\n",
    "3. 90% of the observations have atleast 4 neighors with .001 unit\n",
    "4. Frequency has very low variance and Recency and Monetization has positive correlation.\n",
    "5. Based on elbow method, there are possible 5 to 6 clusters for centroid based clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "I considered the following four clustering techniques:\n",
    "1. Centroid-based: partitional,exclusive,complete,hard clusters\n",
    "2. Density-based: hierarchical,overlapping, partial, hard clusters\n",
    "3. Hierarchical based: hierarchical, exclusive,complete,hard clusters\n",
    "4. Probabilistic model based: partitional, fuzzy,complete, soft clusters\n",
    "5. Graph distance based: model based: partitional, fuzzy,complete, soft clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on my initial observation, I first eliminated centroid based option as this dataset has one non-spherical cluster and centroid based clusters works best only with uniform spherical clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although, from observation it is obvious that KMeans and GMM is not the best fit, I have implemented all the five models for completeness and compared the following metric for each model.\n",
    "1. Min/Max cluster size: A good cluster analysis has each cluster with population between 5-30% of the total population. \n",
    "2. Mean and standard deviation of each cluster are meaningful and are not overlapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above two criteria, we see that Hierarchical model is the most suited model for this dataset. Based on the clusters from Hierarchical model, I created the final RFM summary report.\n",

    "### 2. Problem Statement and Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "With the advent of internet, it has become convenient for the users to search their items of their without stepping out of their house. It has also become convenient for business to communicate with their customers through all the available marketing platforms. Trying to reach everyone at once is a simple and inexpensive strategy but if all business communicates with all customers at once, the audience will get overwhelmed and ignore all communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is then important to focus on a segment of your customer base and develop an effective marketing campaign to get their attention. It then becomes more cost-effective to run on a smaller, more focused scale and receive a better return on investment by targeting consumers who have similar demographics/purchase behavior.The first step to building a successful marketing campaign is defining its target. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, my goal is to build a RFM summary report that create multiple customer segments for targeted marketing campaigns.\n",

    "### 3. Algorithms, Techniques & Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "I considered the following five clustering techniques:\n",
    "1. Centroid-based: \n",
    "    This is a hard clustering technique (where a datapoint is assigned to only one specific cluster) based on it closeness to the centroid of a cluster. This is most effective in case of spherical/convex clusters.\n",
    "2. Density-based: \n",
    "    This is a hard clustering technique where clusters are defined as areas of higher density than the remainder of the data set. Objects in these sparse areas - that are required to separate clusters - are usually considered to be noise and border points.\n",
    "3. Hierarchical based: \n",
    "    This is another hard clustering technique where one cluster can have one or more cluster nested within it. Hierarchical clustering can be divided into two main types: agglomerative(Start with the points as individual clusters and at each step, merge the closest pair of clusters until only one cluster) and divisive (opposite of agglomerative i.e. starts from the top cluster to the leaf node).\n",
    "4. Probability model based: \n",
    "    These is a hard clustering technique based on the notion of how probable is it that all data points in the cluster belong to the same distribution\n",
    "5. Graph Dsitance based: \n",
    "    This is a soft clustering technique where a probability or likelihood of a data point to be in each of those clusters is assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since clustering techniques are evaluated based on on empirical evidence, I used the following two metrics to compare performance of the implemented models on this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Min/Max cluster size: A good cluster analysis has each cluster with population between 5-30% of the total population. \n",
    "2. Mean and standard deviation of each cluster are meaningful and are not overlapping.\n",

    "Different Types of Clusterings\n",
    "hierarchical (nested) versus partitional (unnested)\n",
    "exclusive versus overlapping versus fuzzy\n",
    "complete versus partial\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to ask:\n",
    "Is data Hierarchical versus Partitional:whether the set of clusters is nested or unnestedl. \n",
    "A partitional clustering is simply a division of the set of data objects into non-overlapping subsets (clusters) such that each data object is in exactly one subset. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we permit clusters to have subclusters, then we obtain a hierarchical clustering, which is a set of nested clusters that are organized as a tree. Each node (cluster) in the tree (except for the leaf nodes) is the union of its children (subclusters), and the root of the tree is the cluster containing all the objects. Often, but not always, the leaves of the tree are singleton clusters of individual data objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exclusive versus Overlapping versus Fuzzy There are many situations in which a point could reasonably be placed in more than one cluster, and these situations are better addressed by non-exclusive clustering. In the most general sense, an overlapping or non-exclusive clustering is used to reflect the fact that an object can simultaneously belong to more than one group (class). \n",
    "\n",
    "In a fuzzy clustering, every object belongs to every cluster with a mem- bership weight that is between 0 (absolutely doesn’t belong) and 1 (absolutely belongs). In other words, clusters are treated as fuzzy sets. (Mathematically, a fuzzy set is one in which an object belongs to any set with a weight that is between 0 and 1. In fuzzy clustering, we often impose the additional constraint that the sum of the weights for each object must equal 1.) Similarly, probabilistic clustering techniques compute the probability with which each point belongs to each cluster, and these probabilities must also sum to 1. These approaches are most appropriate for avoiding the arbitrariness of assigning an object to only one cluster when it may be close to several. In practice, a fuzzy or probabilistic clustering is often converted to an exclusive clustering by assigning each object to the cluster in which its membership weight or probability is highest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete versus Partial A complete clustering assigns every object to a cluster, whereas a partial clustering does not. The motivation for a partial clustering is that some objects in a data set may not belong to well-defined groups. Many times objects in the data set may represent noise, outliers, or “uninteresting background.” \n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering aims to find useful groups of objects (clusters), where usefulness is defined by the goals of the data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Well-Separated A cluster is a set of objects in which each object is closer (or more similar) to every other object in the cluster than to any object not in the cluster. Sometimes a threshold is used to specify that all the objects in a cluster must be sufficiently close (or similar) to one another. This idealistic definition of a cluster is satisfied only when the data contains natural clusters that are quite far from each other.Well-separated clusters do not need to be globular, but can have any shape.\n",
    "Prototype-Based A cluster is a set of objects in which each object is closer (more similar) to the prototype that defines the cluster than to the prototype of any other cluster. For data with continuous attributes, the prototype of a cluster is often a centroid, i.e., the average (mean) of all the points in the clus- ter. When a centroid is not meaningful, such as when the data has categorical attributes, the prototype is often a medoid, i.e., the most representative point of a cluster. For many types of data, the prototype can be regarded as the most central point, and in such instances, we commonly refer to prototype- based clusters as center-based clusters. Not surprisingly, such clusters tend to be globular. \n",
    "\n",
    "Graph-Based If the data is represented as a graph, where the nodes are objects and the links represent connections among objects (see Section 2.1.2), then a cluster can be defined as a connected component; i.e., a group of objects that are connected to one another, but that have no connection to objects outside the group. An important example of graph-based clusters are contiguity-based clusters, where two objects are connected only if they are within a specified distance of each other. This implies that each object in a contiguity-based cluster is closer to some other object in the cluster than to any point in a different cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other types of graph-based clusters are also possible. One such approach (Section 8.3.2) defines a cluster as a clique; i.e., a set of nodes in a graph that are completely connected to each other. Specifically, if we add connections between objects in the order of their distance from one another, a cluster is formed when a set of objects forms a clique. Like prototype-based clusters, such clusters tend to be globular.\n",
    "\n",
    "Density-Based A cluster is a dense region of objects that is surrounded by a region of low density. A density- based definition of a cluster is often employed when the clusters are irregular or intertwined, and when noise and outliers are present. \n",
    "\n",
    "Shared-Property (Conceptual Clusters) More generally, we can define a cluster as a set of objects that share some property. This definition encom- passes all the previous definitions of a cluster; e.g., objects in a center-based cluster share the property that they are all closest to the same centroid or medoid. However, the shared-property approach also includes new types of clusters.  a clustering algorithm would need a very specific concept of a cluster to successfully detect these clusters. The process of find- ing such clusters is called conceptual clustering. \n",
    "• K-means. This is a prototype-based, partitional clustering technique that attempts to find a user-specified number of clusters (K), which are represented by their centroids.\n",
    "• Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. This clustering approach refers to a collection of closely related clustering techniques that produce a hierarchical clustering by starting with each point as a singleton cluster and then repeatedly merging the two closest clusters until a single, all- encompassing cluster remains. Some of these techniques have a natural interpretation in terms of graph-based clustering, while others have an interpretation in terms of a prototype-based approach.\n",
    "• DBSCAN. This is a density-based clustering algorithm that produces a partitional clustering, in which the number of clusters is automatically determined by the algorithm. Points in low-density regions are classi- fied as noise and omitted; thus, DBSCAN does not produce a complete clustering.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why normalize?\n",
    "K-means clustering is \"isotropic\" in all directions of space and therefore tends to produce more or less round (rather than elongated) clusters. In this situation leaving variances unequal is equivalent to putting more weight on variables with smaller variance.\n",
    "In distance-based classification, for instance, we need to normalize eache feature value of a feature vector in order to not get conditioned by features with wider range of possible values when computing distances.\n",
    "If a feature has range in [-1,1] and another feature has range in [-100; 100], a small variation in the feature 2 is probably more influencing than a big variation in feature 1 when computing the distance of two feature vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, frequency range is small compared to monetization range. for example a user bought 10 times and spend 1000 and another user bought 20 times and spend 1010. It may seem like the difference in frequency is same as the difference in \n",
    "monetization, which is not the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### K-Means Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means and its variations have a number of limitations with respect to finding different types of clusters. In particular, K-means has difficulty detecting the “natural” clusters, when clusters have non-spherical shapes or widely different sizes or densities.The difficulty in these three situations is that the K-means objective function is a mismatch for the kinds of clusters we are trying to find since it is minimized by globular clusters of equal size and density or by clusters that are well separated. However, these limitations can be overcome, in some sense, if the user is willing to accept a clustering that breaks the natural clusters into a number of subclusters. \n",
    "K-means is simple and can be used for a wide variety of data types. It is also quite efficient, even though multiple runs are often performed. Some variants, including bisecting K-means, are even more efficient, and are less suscepti- ble to initialization problems. K-means is not suitable for all types of data,\n",
    " It cannot handle non-globular clusters or clusters of different sizes and densities, although it can typically find pure subclusters if a large enough number of clusters is specified. K-means also has trouble clustering data that contains outliers. Outlier detection and removal can help significantly in such situations. Finally, K-means is restricted to data for which there is a notion of a center (centroid). A related technique, K-medoid clustering, does not have this restriction, but is more expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means is centroid based technique which works well when there is well defined deparation.\n",
    "In K-means clustering Percentage of variance explained is the ratio of the between-group variance to the total variance, also known as an F-test. A slight variation of this method plots the curvature of the within group variance \n",
    "\n",
    "Prototype-based clustering techniques create a one-level partitioning of the data objects. There are a number of such techniques, but two of the most prominent are K-means and K-medoid. K-means defines a prototype in terms of a centroid, which is usually the mean of a group of points, and is typically\n",
    "(b) Center-based clusters. Each point is closer to the center of its cluster than to the center of any other cluster.\n",
    "(c) Contiguity-based clusters. Each point is closer to at least one point in its cluster than to any point in another cluster.\n",
    "(d) Density-based clusters. Clus- ters are regions of high density sep- arated by regions of low density.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means procedure - which is a vector quantization method often used as a clustering method - does not explicitly use pairwise distances b/w data points at all (in contrast to hierarchical and some other clusterings which allow for arbitrary proximity measure). It amounts to repeatedly assigning points to the closest centroid thereby using Euclidean distance from data points to a centroid. However, K-Means is implicitly based on pairwise Euclidean distances b/w data points, because the sum of squared deviations from centroid is equal to the sum of pairwise squared Euclidean distances divided by the number of points. The term \"centroid\" is itself from Euclidean geometry. It is multivariate mean in euclidean space. Euclidean space is about euclidean distances. Non-Euclidean distances will generally not span Euclidean space. That's why K-Means is for Euclidean distances only.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means clustering is a fast, robust, and simple algorithm that gives reliable results when data sets are distinct or well separated from each other in a linear fashion. It is best used when the number of cluster centers, is specified due to a well-defined list of types shown in the data. However, it is important to keep in mind that K-Means clustering may not perform well if it contains heavily overlapping data, if the Euclidean distance does not measure the underlying factors well, or if the data is noisy or full of outliers \n",
    "\n",
    "The silhouette value is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The silhouette ranges from −1 to +1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.\n",

    "Assume the data have been clustered via any technique, such as k-means, into {\\displaystyle k} k clusters. For each datum {\\displaystyle i} i, let {\\displaystyle a(i)} a(i) be the average distance between {\\displaystyle i} i and all other data within the same cluster.

    "Inertia is not a normalized metric: we just know that lower values are better and zero is optimal. But in very high-dimensional spaces, Euclidean distances tend to become inflated (this is an instance of the so-called “curse of dimensionality”). Running a dimensionality reduction algorithm such as PCA prior to k-means clustering can alleviate this problem and speed up the computations.\n",
